These are PCB layouts which I have made for designs by dylan159 and shared on his [blog](https://bentfishbowl.wixsite.com/electronics). Some of them have faceplates, I would recommend to fab them in 0.8mm. These were designed at various stages of my learning curve in DipTrace, so design principles may not be consistent with older layouts.

You can also find him (and myself and other interesting people) at the [Audio Electronics DIY Discord](https://discord.gg/vcFyJU8j).

These are all made for JLCPCB (hence the marking on the underside) but should work with other fabs. They come with no guarantees or implication of help offered, but they have been verified as working by myself so if there is a problem then it's probably a case of [PEBKAC](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/PEBKAC). Best to find me on Discord.
